      In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, lived
      a youth, whom nature had endowed with the most gentle manners. His countenance
      was a true picture of his soul. He combined a true judgment with simplicity of
      spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old
      servants of the family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's
      sister, by a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady
      would never marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one
      quarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through the
      injuries of time.
